Amped was built around the challenge of integrating custom-built hardware controllers with a Unity-based game system. The goal was to create a seamless, responsive experience where physical inputs directly influenced digital gameplay.

I coordinated real-time input handling, audio systems, and gameplay logic across multiple layers of the application. This required careful timing control, structured communication between hardware and software, and system-level thinking to maintain responsiveness.

One of the biggest challenges involved debugging hardware/software communication delays and resolving timing inconsistencies. Through iterative testing and architectural refinement, I ensured stable performance and reliable real-time interaction.

This project strengthened my ability to think across systems, debug complex integration issues, and design for performance and reliability.
